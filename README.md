# Frontend Task

You have to build an application for composing emails. It has to contain fields for entering the recipients, the subject and
the body of the email. It also has to be possible to attach images to the email. The application will not
actually send any email at all.

## Requirements:

- The component has to be built using only HTML, CSS and JS.
- Include documentation explaining how to run the project (see the ‘How to submit our task’
section below).
- The component must look like the attached mockups (see the ‘Mockups’ section below). Try to
follow a ‘pixel perfect’ philosophy.
- The component has to be rendered correctly in the following browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Internet
Explorer 11, Edge and Safari.
- You have to use pre-processors for building the CSS files (i.e. SASS, LESS, …)

## Used tools

- The app has been developed using React 
- It is based on Bootstrap CSS Framework

## Instructions to run the app

### First of all clone this repo using command 

```
git clone https://github.com/louri91/ebury-frontend-task.git
```

# 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.

## Supported Browsers

By default, the generated project uses the latest version of React.

You can refer [to the React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#browser-support) for more information about supported browsers.
