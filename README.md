# Frontend Task

You have to build an application for composing emails. It has to contain fields for entering the recipients, the subject and
the body of the email. It also has to be possible to attach images to the email. The application will not
actually send any email at all.

## Requirements:

- The component has to be built using only HTML, CSS and JS.
- Include documentation explaining how to run the project (see the ‘How to submit our task’
section below).
- The component must look like the attached mockups (see the ‘Mockups’ section below). Try to
follow a ‘pixel perfect’ philosophy.
- The component has to be rendered correctly in the following browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Internet
Explorer 11, Edge and Safari.
- You have to use pre-processors for building the CSS files (i.e. SASS, LESS, …)

## Used tools

- The app has been developed using React 
- It is based on Bootstrap CSS Framework

## Instructions to run the app on local

First of all clone this repo using command 

```
git clone https://github.com/louri91/ebury-frontend-task.git

Check for the following requirements to run the app:

- Install Node.js (version 5.6.0)

You can download Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
Now we can use npm for installing packages like React.

- Install React
```
npm install react
```
- Install react-scripts 
We use this package to create and run our React app. react-scripts is part of the create-react-app module
```
npm install react-scripts
```
or
```
npm install create-react-app
```

- In the project directory, you can run:
```
npm start
```

This command runs the app in the development mode.<br>
