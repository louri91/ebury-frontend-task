# Frontend Task

You have to build an application for composing emails. It has to contain fields for entering the recipients, the subject and
the body of the email. It also has to be possible to attach images to the email. The application will not
actually send any email at all.

## Requirements:

- The component has to be built using only HTML, CSS and JS.
- Include documentation explaining how to run the project (see the ‘How to submit our task’
section below).
- The component must look like the attached mockups (see the ‘Mockups’ section below). Try to
follow a ‘pixel perfect’ philosophy.
- The component has to be rendered correctly in the following browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Internet
Explorer 11, Edge and Safari.
- You have to use pre-processors for building the CSS files (i.e. SASS, LESS, …)

## Used tools

- The app has been developed using React 
- It is based on Bootstrap CSS Framework
